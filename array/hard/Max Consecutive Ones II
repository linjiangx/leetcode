'''
store the length of previous and current consecutive 1's (separated by the last 0) as pre and curr , respectively. 
Whenever we get a new number, update these two variables accordingly.
The consecutive length would be pre + 1 + curr, where the 1 is a zero that got flipped to 1. 
(note that pre is initialized to -1, meaning that we haven't seen any 0 yet)

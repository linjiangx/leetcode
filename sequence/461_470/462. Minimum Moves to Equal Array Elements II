        Why would a simple difference to the average not work?
        Here is a counter example:
        [1,4,4] => mean is 3 => 1 + 1 + 2 while best solution is 3
        
        Why would a simple difference to the median not work?
        [1,3,4,4] => median is 3 or 4... both cases lead to 4, the correct answer
        [1,2,4,4] => median is 2 or 4... both cases load to 5, the correct answer
        
        It actually works, with both lower and upper median.

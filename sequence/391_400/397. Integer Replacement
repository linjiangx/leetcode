According to description, if we have an even number, n=n/2, if it is odd, n=n-1or n=n+1
In intuition, it is better to use n=n-1 because it makes the number smaller but why sometimes n=n+1 is better?
This is because we can have more chances to use n=n/2 which is more efficient.
Given any odd number, the difference between +1 or -1 is whether it can be divid by 4.(just try some numbers like 7,15,19)
So I had the following intuition code, even number/2, odd number, make it n%4==0 by +1,-1
3 is an accident, we have to deal with it in special way

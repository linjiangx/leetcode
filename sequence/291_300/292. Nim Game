        As in any adversarial game, player 1 wins if he can play a move in which player 2 cannot win
        In NIM's game, this translates into:
        - 1, 2, 3: the one who plays wins
        - 4: the one who plays loses (falls to 1, 2, 3)
        - 5, 6, 7: the one who plays wins (just play to get 4)
        - 8: the one who plays loses (falls to 5, 6, 7)
        - Etc
        So you only need to test for position that are multiple of 4.
